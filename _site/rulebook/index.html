<p><strong>Registration &amp; Rosters</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>One player may ONLY play for 1 team with ONLY ONE account. Violations of this rule will be handled as a Fair Play violation.</li>

      <li>Players who wish to change their account such as switching to their main or mini account will NOT be allowed unless during roster change periods. </li>
      <li>Players who are discovered to be in more than one roster may NOT be replaced, unless during a roster change period.</li>
      <li>In-game name changes are allowed, as long as the correct player tag is provided in the original roster. You may contact NSL staff via TicketTool or ModMail if you experience any difficulty with regard to this matter.</li>

<p><strong>Match Regulations</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Only managers and referees/admins may talk in clan chat (it is recommended to give these people elder/co-leader so they stand out.) </li>
  <li>Sportsmanship is an expectation: toxicity, BM in clan chat, and other unsportsmanlike behavior is not tolerated in this league and may be punished.
    <ul>
      <li>In game BM is FINE, as long as it’s not in the clan chat</li>
      <li>Managers/Players may dm Modmail/TicketTool to report unsportsmanlike behavior.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Players have 2 mins to request and accept matches after being prompted to do so. You may claim a Free win (FW) if you say “We will claim FW if the player doesn’t accept within the next 30 seconds.” You must count down from 30, 15, 10 9 8….3, 2, 1 to claim the FW. If a player uses a banned card, the opponent will get a free win for that game only.
    <ul>
      <li>However, if a player has a banned card in their deck but does not use it, then that’s fine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the event of technical difficulties, refer to the following guidelines:
    <ul>
      <li>If a game-breaking bug occurs (such as the one that kicks a player back into clan chat during a battle) and the affected player can provide solid evidence of said bug such as saying “I was kicked out in clan chat”, the affected game must be replayed.</li>
      <li>If a player lags out due to a bad internet connection or a slow device, the game will NOT be replayed and the match result will be accepted as the players/managers are responsible for their own internet connection.</li>
      <li>If a manager lags out/disconnects another player/manager from that team may announce and take over. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All cards will be allowed for the whole duration of the league.</li>
  <li>In qualifiers, groups, and the first 2 rounds of playoffs, lineups and bans (if applicable) will be declared in clan chat during the match.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are STRICTLY PROHIBITED in NSL:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any slander or disrespectful language used in league clans or on any other messaging platform including direct messages, twitter, and the league server against opposing players, teams, or NSL is strictly prohibited and will be investigated for consequences. </li>
  <li>Using a shared account during a match

</ul>

<p>To report a fair play offense, DM modmail. All fair play reports are rigorously investigated.</p>

<p>Any team that stands to win money (1st, 2nd, and 3rd places) will be automatically investigated for fair play before any money is released. </p>
